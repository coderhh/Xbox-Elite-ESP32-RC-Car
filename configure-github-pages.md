# GitHub Pages Configuration Guide

## Current Issue
Your GitHub Pages is currently configured with an expired custom domain. Here's how to fix it and use the free GitHub Pages domain.

## Steps to Fix GitHub Pages

### 1. Remove Custom Domain (if any)
1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/coderhh/Xbox-Elite-ESP32-RC-Car
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section in the left sidebar
4. If you see a custom domain configured, click **Remove** or **Unlink** it

### 2. Configure GitHub Pages Source
1. In the **Pages** settings, under **Source**:
   - Select **GitHub Actions** (not "Deploy from a branch")
2. This will use the workflow we created in `.github/workflows/pages.yml`

### 3. Wait for Deployment
1. The GitHub Actions workflow should automatically deploy your site
2. Your site will be available at: `https://coderhh.github.io/Xbox-Elite-ESP32-RC-Car/`

### 4. Verify the Site
1. After the workflow completes successfully, visit: https://coderhh.github.io/Xbox-Elite-ESP32-RC-Car/
2. You should see your beautiful project showcase website

## Troubleshooting

### If the site doesn't load:
1. Check the Actions tab in your repository to see if the workflow is running
2. Look for any error messages in the workflow logs
3. Make sure the workflow has the correct permissions

### If you still see the expired domain:
1. Clear your browser cache
2. Try accessing the site in an incognito/private window
3. Wait a few minutes for DNS propagation
